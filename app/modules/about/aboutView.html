                            <p>1App is a 'single-page application' (SPA). That is the term for a web application or web site
                                that fits on a single web page. The goal is to provide a more fluid user experience akin
                                to a desktop application.
                            </p>

                            <p>Traditional web applications often work slowly, and require the page to refresh regularly to
                                update information, especially if the information comes from a database. Many new technologies
                                for web applications are now available, however, that change the traditional method of creating
                                web-based applications. Angular-Point-Example has embraced the use of these cutting-edge
                                technologies to provide you with a rich, responsive, and fast user interface.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the future, many of what we now think of as desktop applications will be moved to web-based
                                formats, much as Google has done with word processing and spreadsheet applications. This
                                will free users from dependence on a particular operating system or type of computer. Desktops,
                                laptops, tablets, and phones will all be able to run these SPAs, and the functionality will
                                be the same, no matter what platform you use. This will open an entirely new era in which
                                we will think about software in an entirely different way&mdash;and won't have to think about
                                the platform that runs it.</p>

                            <p>Think of 1App as your first step into this new era.</p>
