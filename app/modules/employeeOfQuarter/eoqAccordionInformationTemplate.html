		<p>Angular-Point-Example does not currently have an established employee recognition program. There are pockets of informal Branch/Section
			awards with limited visibility of recognition across the Division. In addition, it has been challenging to get nominations
			submitted into the command-level quarterly awards which are based upon very specific categories. Due to the reduced level
			of morale, we believe that establishing such a program would be greatly welcomed and appreciated by our team mates. With
			such a program, the leadership team also demonstrates commitment to the leadership practice of encouraging the heart.
		</p>
		<p>Recently, the organization identified four aspirational values through the leadership challenge: excellence, teamwork,
			integrity, and innovation. An established award program supports values communication by recognizing personnel that demonstrate
			alignment to one or more of these values.</p>
